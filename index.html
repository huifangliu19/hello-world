      <h2>Daily Life In The Valley</h2>
      <p>This culture began to form about five thousand years
  ago and lasted for more than two thousand years. It's hard to imagine
  that boys and girls, men and women who lived so long ago experienced
  many of the same things we do today. They played games, discussed the
 latest fashions, wrote down their thoughts, sang and played music, grew
 tired at the end of a long workday, and looked  forward to a good meal.</p>

    <h3>Old Kingdom</h3>
    <p>The Old Kingdom began with the third dynasty of pharaohs. Around
2630 B.C. the third dynasty's King Djoser asked Imhotep, an architect,priest
and healer, to design a funerary monument for him; the result was the world's
first major stone building, the Step-Pyramid at Saqqara, near Memphis.
Pyramid-building reached its zenith with the construction of the Great Pyramid
at Giza,on the outskirts of Cairo. Built for Khufu (or Cheops, in Greek),
who ruled from 2589 to 2566 B.C., the pyramid was later  named by classical
 historians as one of the ancient world’s Seven Wonders.</p>
